Here is the context:

Arriving at the Sacred Timeline in the year 2018, Wade Wilson meets with Happy Hogan, trying to apply for the Avengers. Wilson is desperate to find a proper use for his abilities and get his life together, but Hogan is not impressed. He cites Wilson's problems with teamwork and tells him that one joins the Avengers not because he needs it, but because others need him. Wilson gets rejected, quits his life as Deadpool and starts working as a car salesman at Drive Max, while Vanessa Carlysle breaks up with him. Six years later in his universe, his friends threw him a birthday party, where he thanks everyone for sticking up with him, but suddenly, the Time Variance Authority agents arrive at Wilson's apartment and capture him.
Mr. Paradox meets Wilson at the Time Variance Authority Office and offers him a proper place on the Sacred Timeline with the Avengers. Wilson is excited about his long-awaited Marvel Cinematic Universe debut and suits up as Deadpool once again, eager to share the news with his friends. However, Paradox explains that his universe is on the brink of dying due to losing an anchor that held his reality together, said anchor being Wolverine who died protecting X-23. Paradox also expresses his dissatisfaction with the current leadership of the TVA and adds that he is planning to speed up the destruction of Wilson's universe by using the Time Ripper.
Horrified that he is about to lose his home and friends, Deadpool goes against the TVA and decides to find Wolverine and save his universe. Stealing a TemPad, Deadpool exhumes Wolverine's grave but finds out that he is completely dead, before fighting off the Minutemen pursuing him. Deadpool keeps searches for Wolverine variants across the Multiverse to replace the deceased one, but most of them are either too hostile or are not suitable enough, with the exception of one he meets at a bar in Canada. Wolverine is not interested in hearing Deadpool out, but eventually gets too drunk to fight him and passes out. Deadpool brings the unconscious Wolverine to the TVA, but Paradox only laughs at him, saying that he managed to bring the worst Wolverine variant to ever exist.
Deadpool finds out that Paradox is acting without the TVA's authorization, but both he and Wolverine get pruned and sent to the Void, where Wolverine comes to his senses and attacks Deadpool. The two fight for some time, until Deadpool tells Wolverine that if they make it back to the TVA, they could change his past and prevent the catastrophe that happened to him. Wolverine begrudgingly agrees, before they meet Johnny Storm, whom Deadpool assumes to be Captain America, as well as a group of rogue scavengers, led by Sabretooth. Pyro depowers Storm and Wolverine kills Sabertooth, however, Pyro and Toad manage to capture all three of them and bring them along with a Minuteman to their base in the giant corpse of Ant-Man.
Deadpool and Wolverine get introduced to Cassandra Nova, a twin sister of Charles Xavier who was banished to the Void by the TVA, to her own satisfaction. Deadpool claims that while they were being transported to the camp, Storm repeatedly insulted Nova and despite him denying it, she kills Storm by skinning him with her telekinesis. Nova then incapacitates Wolverine and forcefully gets into Deadpool's mind, hijacking his memories of Carlysle to tell him that he will always be nobody. Deadpool and Wolverine recover and attack Nova, but she effortlessly brushes them off and leaves them to be devoured by Alioth, although they manage to escape.
They decide to find the Resistance that Storm mentioned and get out of the Void, while Deadpool keeps badgering Wolverine about his suit and why keeps wearing it. On their way, they meet two Deadpool variants, Dogpool and her owner Nicepool. Despite Deadpool's antagonism towards Nicepool, the latter gives them directions to the Void's borderlands and provides them with a car to make it there. While driving, Deadpool accidentally slips up that he is not certain that the TVA will fix Wolverine's reality, admitting that he made an "educated wish". Wolverine is enraged and lashes out at Deadpool, which results in both of them fighting each other until both are too exhausted, and someone drives their car to the Resistance Hideout.
There, they meet Elektra, Blade, and Gambit variants, led by X-23 who had been banished to the Void by the TVA. Deadpool convinces the Resistance to team up and take on Nova and avenge Storm's death, while leaving out the reason why he died. Wolverine scoffs that their plan is doomed to fail and refuses to join them, so X-23 goes to talk to him.
Wolverine admits that in his universe, he abandoned his fellow X-Men, which resulted in them being killed by the anti-mutant vigilantes, much to his horror and despair, so he keeps wearing the X-Man suit since then. X-23 tells Wolverine that regardless of what he thinks about himself, he is still a good person at heart and always will be. Meanwhile, Pyro follows Deadpool and Wolverine's tracks and strikes a deal with Paradox, who decides that Nova is too dangerous and must be eliminated.
With Wolverine joining them, the Resistance storms Nova's base, planning to acquire Juggernaut's helmet to neutralize Nova's psychic ability. Nova knocks Deadpool out and subdues Wolverine, taking over his mind and urges him to give in to his primal instincts and let himself loose, promising to shut down his trauma. However, Wolverine rejects her and Deadpool puts Juggernaut's helmet provided by X-23 on her, rendering her completely powerless, demanding her to release them from the Void. Suddenly, Nova gets shot by Pyro and Wolverine tells Deadpool to take off the helmet and save her, claiming that the Charles Xavier he knew would never want him to let Nova die.
As Deadpool obliges, Nova relents and uses a Sling Ring having the Reality and Time Stones attached to it to open an Inter-Dimensional Portal out of the Void, so he and Wolverine can escape right before Alioth devours the whole base. Nova then forces Pyro to admit that he tried to kill her on Paradox's orders, despite them having a prior agreement about her. Deadpool and Wolverine make it to Earth-10005, where Paradox finishes preparing the Time Ripper, and Nova follows suit, killing Pyro afterwards. Nova tells them that she intends to use the Time Ripper and turn the whole Multiverse into the Void that she loves so much, capturing Paradox and sending the Deadpool Corps to stop Deadpool and Wolverine.
Deadpool and Wolverine fight through the hordes of Deadpool variants, who keep coming back due to their regeneration, however, they all cease fighting once they see Peter Wisdom, who is deeply loved by all Deadpools. With them distracted, Deadpool and Wolverine make it to Paradox who tells them that Nova already took control over the Time Ripper and is preparing to unravel the entire Multiverse. He tells them that the only way to stop this is to short-circuit the chambers of matter and anti-matter that power the device, however, it is all but guaranteed to kill them even with their regeneration. Wolverine says he should be the one to do it, claiming that he has nothing to fight for anymore, however, Deadpool locks him out of the bunker and prepares to sacrifice himself instead.
Despite Wolverine's protests, Deadpool decides that he must do it himself to save everyone he loves, however, Wolverine breaks in and connects the chamber with him, resulting in the destruction of the Time Ripper and Nova's death. B-15 and the TVA come to investigate the incident, with Paradox claiming that Nova is solely responsible while mourning the deaths of Deadpool and Wolverine, however, they manage to survive by sharing the energy burst between each other. Paradox gets taken under custody and Deadpool asks B-15 to do good by their Resistance allies who were left in the Void and fix Wolverine's home reality. B-15 promises to consider the former but notes that Wolverine's unfortunate circumstances were what led him to save the Multiverse.
Wilson and Logan then go on to have some shawarma and get reunited with Dogpool, now that Nicepool got killed in the battle. Wilson takes both of them to his place with Blind Al, inviting their friends and X-23 to hang out together, and Wilson rekindles his relationship with Carlysle.
In a post-credits scene, Deadpool pulls up the footage of Storm actually cursing out Nova, proving that he did not lie about with Storm said.

In 2018, after Wade Wilson uses Cable's time-travel device to prevent the death of his girlfriend Vanessa,[a] he travels from his universe, Earth-10005,[b] to Earth-616 on the "Sacred Timeline",[c] hoping to join the Avengers and give his life added meaning. He is rejected by Happy Hogan and returns to his universe. Six years later, Wade has broken up with Vanessa, retired from being the masked mercenary Deadpool, and works as a used-car salesman with his friend and former X-Force member, Peter Wisdom.
During Wade's birthday party, the Time Variance Authority captures him and brings him to Paradox, who explains that they are an organization outside of time that monitors the Sacred Timeline and wider multiverse, and offers him an important role on Earth-616. Wade initially accepts, however Paradox then reveals that Wade's timeline is deteriorating as a result of the death of its stabilizing "anchor being", Logan, while protecting his daughter Laura.[d] Paradox plans to use a "Time Ripper" device to accelerate this process, so Wade steals his TemPad and uses it to travel to Logan's grave, hoping to resurrect him and save their timeline. When this fails, Wade travels the multiverse searching for a replacement alternate universe "variant" of Logan.
Wade returns to the TVA with a Logan variant but is told by Paradox that an anchor being cannot be replaced, and that this variant is considered "the worst Wolverine" in the multiverse. When Wade deduces that Paradox is acting without the knowledge of his superiors, Paradox sends Wade and Logan to the Void where all things are consumed by the creature Alioth. Logan agrees to work with Wade when he claims that the TVA can change his timeline. Wade and Logan are captured alongside Johnny Storm and taken to Cassandra Nova, the powerful and sadistic twin sister of X-Men leader Charles Xavier. Cassandra, who made a deal with the TVA to oversee the Void, kills Johnny and leaves Wade and Logan to be consumed by Alioth, but the pair manage to escape.
Logan and Wade meet a Deadpool variant called "Nicepool" who directs them towards a resistance group that have been fighting Cassandra. On the way, Logan realizes that Wade is lying about the TVA being able to fix his timeline, and the pair fight until both are left unconscious. They are found by the resistance group, consisting of Laura, Elektra, Blade, and Gambit. Wade proposes an alliance to fight Cassandra, and Laura convinces Logan, distraught over his reluctance that led to the death of his fellow X-Men, to join the cause. The resistance members distract Cassandra's henchmen while Wade and Logan block her powers by placing Juggernaut's helmet on her head. Cassandra is betrayed by her follower Pyro on behalf of Paradox, and almost dies until Logan convinces Wade to remove the helmet. Cassandra heals herself and opens a portal to Earth-10005, which Logan and Wade jump through.
Cassandra learns about Paradox's plan from Pyro, kills him, and follows Logan and Wade to Earth-10005. She learns about the Time Ripper's completion and how to use it from Paradox's mind and plans to destroy all timelines, leaving only the Void. Cassandra summons an army of Deadpool variants, who kill "Nicepool" and battle Wade and Logan until Peter arrives and distracts them. Paradox tells Wade and Logan that one of them could destroy the Time Ripper by disrupting its power flow, but this would kill them, even with their powers. Both Wade and Logan destroy the Time Ripper together, killing Cassandra in the process, and are able to survive by sharing the burden. Paradox is arrested by the TVA's Hunter B-15, who congratulates Wade and Logan and says their actions have stopped Earth-10005 from deteriorating. Wade asks Hunter B-15 to save the resistance group from the Void and change the history of Logan's world. She explains that the latter is not possible because Logan's history is what led to him being a hero now, and allows Logan to stay in Wade's world. Wade invites Logan to meet his friends, and with encouragement from Logan, reconciles with Vanessa.
